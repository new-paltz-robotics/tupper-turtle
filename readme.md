Tupper-turtle is a relatively simple robot rover created by the [Robotics Lab at SUNY New Paltz](http://www.botsandbrains.com/group/new-paltz-robotics-lab). It uses 2 light sensors (photo-resistors) on each side of its head to figure out where there is more light and it will turn and drive toward that direction. This was our first MVP (minimal viable product) to make sure the motors and similar controls were working, but it had some interesting behavior when put into the real world as you can see below.  Since most obsticles block light, it worked as a crude collision avoidance system. We intend to continue to expand the robot's capabilities in the future.
